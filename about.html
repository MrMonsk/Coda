<p>I double majored in Biology and Music at Bowdoin College, and went on to pursue a masters in Music Composition at Bowling Green State University under Marilyn Shrude. After one year at my masters, I left because new concert music just isn't for me.</p>

<p>I love music, exercise, and coding.</p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="/contact/index.html">contact</a> me about anything related to these things.</p>
