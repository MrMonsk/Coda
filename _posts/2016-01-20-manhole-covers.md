I've been told that this is the most popular "real-world" question that interviewers will ask to glean information about one's problem-solving abilities. 

Okay, so why _are_ manholes round? The first thought that came to my mind was that manhole covers should be either round or square to get rid any possibility that the cover could slip down into the hole. Next, I thought maybe the round shape allows the average person to more easily move the cover (i.e. roll it like a wheel over picking it up outright). This seemed like a good answer until I wondered how manhole covers might travel in bulk. Square manhole covers would stack much tighter with each other, giving credence to a square manhole cover, yet there would probably be greater production problems when building square manhole covers with all those corners that would likely get chipped or broken. Finally, round manhole covers have the advantage over square covers in that no corners need to be lined up, making it less frustrating for workers (probably). Let's just hope those workers already got the [benefits](http://www.brighthubeducation.com/toddler-activities-learning/90510-using-shape-sorters-in-the-classroom/) of a shape-sorter thingy as a kid:

So, circular manhole covers win over square ones, but maybe the reason is simply because circles are prettier than square ones since they are harder to draw freehand unless if you're Spongebob.
